Hello, I am April Gray. Currently, I am senior attending Lamar University.
I began my studies by learning Java. Many assignments and projects later
I gained my footing and became curious about what else was out there. Soon I found myself delving
into python, c, and c++, though I can't yet claim to be adept at them. Wanting to be able to easily
show my projects online I decided to invest into learning Javascript.

Besides studying and advancing my programming, I love to spend time playing with my dog or relax with video games.
